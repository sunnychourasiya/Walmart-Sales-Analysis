## 🔍 Problem Statement

Supermarket leadership lacked a consolidated analytics framework to answer essential business questions across branches, customers, products, and demand cycles.  
Key gaps included:

- No clear visibility into **branch-level revenue and profitability**
- Limited understanding of **Member vs Normal customer behavior**
- No structured view of **high-margin or fast-moving product categories**
- Insufficient insight into **peak sales hours, days, and monthly cycles**

These limitations affected **inventory decisions**, **staffing efficiency**, **promotional planning**, and **customer targeting**.  
This project addresses these challenges by building a complete SQL → Power BI pipeline that transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights.

---

## Project Objectives

- Identify the key revenue, customer, and product factors driving supermarket performance  
- Compare sales and profitability patterns across branches, customer segments, and product categories  
- Engineer analytical fields that enhance demand analysis, margin evaluation, and customer segmentation  
- Deliver actionable insights to support pricing, inventory planning, staffing, and category management teams  
- Establish a clean, scalable analytical foundation suitable for advanced forecasting and retail BI expansion  

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions

### Revenue & Sales Performance
- Which branch generates the highest revenue and profit?
- Which product lines contribute most to profitability?
- How do revenue trends vary by hour, day, and month?

### Customer Insights
- Do Members spend more than Normal customers?
- How do gender-based purchasing patterns differ?
- Which categories receive the highest customer ratings?

### Product Profitability
- Which product lines produce the highest gross income?
- Is there a relationship between customer ratings and purchase volume?

### Branch Comparison
- Which branch demonstrates the strongest operational performance?
- How do satisfaction ratings vary across locations?

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Transformation (MySQL)  
**SQL File:** `Supermarket_Sales.sql`

### Key Steps Performed

- Created database schema & staging environment
- Cleaned fields and standardized column types
- Derived time-based fields using SQL functions: 
  - `MONTHNAME(date)`  
  - `DAYNAME(date)`  
  - `HOUR(time)`  
- Calculated KPIs (Revenue, Tax, COGS, Gross Income, Margin %)
- Generated aggregated tables for Power BI modeling 

### Example SQL Queries

**Total Revenue**
```sql
SELECT SUM(total) AS total_revenue FROM Supermarket_Sales;
```

**Category-Level Profitability Ranking**
```sql
SELECT product_line,
       SUM(gross_income) AS total_profit
FROM Supermarket_Sales
GROUP BY product_line
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;
```

**Hourly Sales Trend**
```sql
SELECT HOUR(time) AS hour_of_day,
       SUM(total) AS revenue
FROM Supermarket_Sales
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(supermarket_sales[Total])

Total Quantity = SUM(supermarket_sales[Quantity])

Gross Income = SUM(supermarket_sales[Gross income])

Gross Margin % = DIVIDE(
    [Gross Income],
    SUM(supermarket_sales[COGS])
)

Average Rating = AVERAGE(supermarket_sales[Rating])

Revenue MoM % Change =
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD(Date[Date], -1, MONTH)),
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD(Date[Date], -1, MONTH))
)
```
